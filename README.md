You just have to execute the localGame.py with python :

## Files

The Reversi file is the implementation of the Reversi Game.

The localGame file is the game that you want to start (ex: Random player vs PVS player). 

The PVS and Random player files are 2 implementation of differents AI.

You will find the details of our implementation and why we did it like that in the README.txt.

## Next

It could be very interesting to implement the graphic side of the app (pygame for example), and a "real player" part (to play vs the AI).
